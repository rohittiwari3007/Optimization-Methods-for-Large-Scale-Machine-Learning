To run the code, simply run ex2 file.

The default data set used is the one in Andrew Ng's example 2.

To test on other data sets:
Use data sets in the "data-sets" folder. Corresponding input and output parameters have already been mentioned in the code, in ex2.m file. It just needs to be uncommented to use the desired data set. 

Please note the data file must be moved to the code folder or the path in the ex2.m must be updated for the code to run successfully.
